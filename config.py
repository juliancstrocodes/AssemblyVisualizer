DEFINITIONS = ["The mov instruction copies the data item referred to by its first operand (i.e. register contents, memory contents, or a constant value) into the location referred to by its second operand (i.e. a register or memory). While register-to-register moves are possible, direct memory-to-memory moves are not. In cases where memory transfers are desired, the source memory contents must first be loaded into a register, then can be stored to the destination memory address.",
               "The push instruction places its operand onto the top of the hardware supported stack in memory. Specifically, push first decrements ESP by 4, then places its operand into the contents of the 32-bit location at address (%esp). ESP (the stack pointer) is decremented by push since the x86 stack grows down â€” i.e. the stack grows from high addresses to lower addresses.",

It first moves the 4 bytes located at memory location (%esp) into the specified register or memory location, and then increments ESP by 4.",

Note, the contents of the memory location are not loaded, only the effective address is computed and placed into the register. This is useful for obtaining a pointer into a memory region or to perform simple arithmetic operations.",

               "The imul instruction has two basic formats: two-operand (first two syntax listings above) and three-operand (last two syntax listings above). The two-operand form multiplies its two operands together and stores the result in the second operand. The result (i.e. second) operand must be a register. The three operand form multiplies its second and third operands together and stores the result in its last operand. Again, the result operand must be a register. Furthermore, the first operand is restricted to being a constant value.",
